## Getting started
- The first thing you need is node. For installation you can go to [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Next you need Gulp. Once you have node installed you can follow the installation instructions [here](https://gulpjs.com/).
- Now you must clone this repository. Path to the repository folder and type `npm install`, it will automatically install all the dependencies needed to make the system work.

At this point everything is ready for you to start working.
```bash
  gulp watch
```
